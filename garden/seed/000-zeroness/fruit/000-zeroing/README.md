# Aunix

**An Operating System for Human Consciousness**

## What is Aunix?

Aunix is a unified framework that integrates:
- Ancient wisdom traditions (Buddhism, Taoism, Christianity)
- Modern cognitive science and AI
- Systems theory and information processing
- Practical applications for daily life

### Two Tracks

**Developer Track**: Theoretical framework for understanding consciousness, solving the Hard Problem, and designing systems

**User Track**: Practical applications for self-observation, dialogue, relationships, and personal growth

## Core Concepts

### Three-Layer Architecture (ni/ui/ai)

```
ni (Natural/Native Intelligence)
- Continuous, nameless, boundless
- The field of possibilities
- Hardware layer

ui (Universal/United Intelligence)  
- Selection and interpretation (Attention + LLM)
- The Zeroing Engine
- Operating system layer

ai (Artificial/Application Intelligence)
- Discrete, manifested reality
- Individual consciousness
- Application layer
```

### Zeroness

The fundamental principle: **Everything begins from zero and returns to zero**

- Selection = Discarding (Attention zeros out 999/1000)
- Creation = Destruction
- Life = Death
- Writing = Erasing

From Zeroness came All  
Through Zeroing emerged One  
To Zeroness all returns"*
